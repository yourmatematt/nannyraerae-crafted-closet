              It all started when I became a grandmother — but really, the story goes back even further.
            </p>
            
            <p className="font-inter text-lg text-muted-foreground mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              I’ve been sewing for over 60 years. I first sat at a sewing machine with my grandmother when I was just 5 years old. Since then, I’ve made clothes for all of my children throughout their lives, always with one goal — to create garments that could handle the rough-and-tumble reality of childhood.
            </p>

            <p className="font-inter text-lg text-muted-foreground mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              Now as a grandmother, that same purpose continues — making clothing that isn’t just beautiful, but built to last, to be loved, to be handed down. Each piece is thoughtfully designed and carefully handmade in my home studio, using quality fabrics and sometimes recycled materials for truly unique pieces.
            </p>

# Project Context - Check claude_project_status.md First

**CRITICAL:** Read `claude_project_status.md` before ANY task to avoid rebuilding completed features.

## Tech Stack (ACTUAL)
- React + Vite + TypeScript (NOT Next.js)
- Supabase (project: kqshrevhtrusxrwkgdmd)
- Stripe + Brevo emails (NOT Resend)
- Australian market only (no multi-currency)
- Context API (NOT Zustand)

## Already Complete (DON'T rebuild)
- ✅ Full admin dashboard with product management
- ✅ Image upload to Supabase Storage
- ✅ Stripe checkout with webhooks
- ✅ Order/email system working
- ✅ Product categorization (gender, type, collection, gift ideas)
- ✅ One-of-a-kind model (stock = 1 or 0)

## Not Implemented (Future)
- Cart hold/reservation system
- Multi-currency
- Wishlist/reviews
- Email automation
- Australia Post API

## Key Decisions
- Stock: 1 = Available, 0 = Sold (simple for one-of-a-kind)
- Shipping: $12 flat rate (no GST)
- Email: Brevo for transactional, manual for newsletters
